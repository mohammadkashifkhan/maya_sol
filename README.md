Created with Flutter. Tested on Android.

Business logic:
1st Screen
• User should be able to login and logout of the application
• The user should be able to sign out in any of the succeeding screens
2nd Screen
• It should show the user's current balance (e.g. 500.00php)
• Clicking show/hide icon should hide the amount (e.g. ******) and vice versa
• Clicking send money button should open the 2nd screen
• Clicking view transactions button should open the 3rd screen
3rd Screen
• User should enter the amount he/she wants to send. Textfield should only accept numbers.
• Clicking submit button should show a bottom sheet to indicate success/failure
4th Screen
- This screen should show all the transactions made by the user. Should show details like the amount sent.

Note : 
- Must have unit test - Didn't get time to finish this, as I completed this assignment in multiple sittings because of some other engagements.
• Must use API to post and get transactions. - Raised a query regarding this requirement to HR. She didn't reply back and after continous back & forth, she said to complete this without any API integration. So I finished this with the help of an internal DB. Similarly, bonus requirements could not be fulfilled.
